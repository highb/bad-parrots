## What is this?

Some mise scripts for setting up my local LLM environment. Maybe you'll find them
useful. Review them before running, since my local setup might not work for you.

## Usage

1. Install [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/)
2. `mise run` to see list of tasks
3. `mise run ollama:docker_setup` first, then `mise run ollama:docker_run` Yes, mise can handle dependencies, I just haven't bothered yet.
